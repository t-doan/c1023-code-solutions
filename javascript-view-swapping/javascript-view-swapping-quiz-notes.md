## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `event.target`?
  the element that is accessible when we initiate the event

- What is the affect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  it "hides" the element

- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  a string value and returns the element with that string value aka class or id

- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  element.getAttribute(string value)

- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  when getting and setting values into a variable or object

- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
  We would have to put another function code that has an event listener check for that specific tab and view

- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
  we would have to target the view individually and specifically to conditionally check if the values are equal
