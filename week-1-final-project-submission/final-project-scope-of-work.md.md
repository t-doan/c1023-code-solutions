## Write Up

<!--- Final project write up goes here --->

For the project, I would like to the user to be able to add games to their favorites or to a list that the user have created. I wold also like to the user to be able to create a review and have the game details to show reviews from the users or other users. For the profile page for the user, I would like the user to be able to customize their profile and see all their ratings and reviews of games they have done. The challenges I am facing are a lot of other things I would need to edit as changes are needed for the database since I initially had an idea of it, but as I continue to work on the project, it needs to be change so the implementation functions as it should. Right now, my plan to overcome these challenges is to continue to work and edit as I go. I do have a lot of features that I should remove for the project or can add on later on. That is the scope for me. For the assignment itself, I would like ot believe it is complete.
