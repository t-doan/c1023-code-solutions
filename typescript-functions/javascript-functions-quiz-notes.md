## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a function is a tool in which a set of code is programmed to do something and can be reuse throughout the program

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword
  function name
  parameters
  codeblock or curly brace {}
  return statement

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  function name
  parentheses ()
  the arguments needed for the function.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  defining a function is what the function should be doing.
  calling a function is running the codes inside the function

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameters are placeholders for the function. When the function is called, the parameters will take on the value of the argument that is passed.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They are placeholders to help identify what needs to be passed for the function.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

1. Cause the function to produce a value we can use
2. Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run
