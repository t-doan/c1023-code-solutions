## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
breakpoints are points where media query are introduced and changes the layout

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
it will always position itself consistently at a percentage of the viewpoint rather than the specific pixel

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
CSS rules is cascading order so the styles will be applied based on the the recent rule as it goes through the file.
